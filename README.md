# MeetingPulse Attendee API example

This is a sample single-page app using Vue CLI.

It features some of MeetingPulse API invocations to manage meetings as Presenter, as well as creating Attendee sessions to participate in said meetings, by an example of using the poll voting functionality.

## Project setup

The project is intended to be built into a single HTML file to be shipped as a simple self-contained prototype.

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Grab `dist/index.html` that can be opened locally

## Working on project

This is a stock Vue CLI project with most things set to default, including linting.

- `npm run serve` runs a local dev webserver;
- `npm run build` generates the `dist` versions for shipping;
- `npm run lint` runs the automatic linting
